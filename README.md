# os

A simple operating system written in Rust.

I'm following [Philip Oppermann's excellent OS series](https://os.phil-opp.com/) to
get started, but I intend to eventually explore other operating system designs,
such as [QNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX) and [Xinu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinu).
